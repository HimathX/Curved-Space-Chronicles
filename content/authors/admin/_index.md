Sasandu Graushinghe is diving deep into Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, but donâ€™t be fooledâ€”heâ€™s got physics posters on his wall and quantum dreams in his head. Obsessed with signals, gadgets, and anything that hums, beeps, or breaks the speed of light (theoretically, for now), heâ€™s the guy whoâ€™ll argue that SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s cat couldâ€™ve built a better antenna. Sasandu blends engineering smarts with a physicistâ€™s curiosityâ€”and just a hint of mad scientist energy.
